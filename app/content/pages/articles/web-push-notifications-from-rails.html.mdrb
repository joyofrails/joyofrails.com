You may have heard news: Rails 8 will extract a new framework for Web Push in Rails. Web Push notifications are powerful because they allow your Rails application to engage with your users _even when they’re not on your site_.

<%= image_tag "articles/web-push-notifications-from-rails/a-web-push-notification.jpg", alt: "A Web Push Notification" %>

In advance of [Rails Action Notifier](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50454), it may be helpful to know how things will work under the hood. In this article, we’ll cover the basics of implementing Web Push yourself with Rails.

This article has something you won’t find in most posts about Web Push: a working demo! (in supporting browsers and devices) 😅. Try it below.

## Demo

Want to see it in action?

Normally, a Web Push notification would be triggered by some event on the server side. This demo allows you to send a push notification to yourself by clicking a few buttons in this article.

First click the Subscribe button below. You may have also need to accept a browser dialog to allow notifications.

<%= render Pwa::WebPushDemo.new %>

I’m not persisting this subscription in any way so you will only receive a notification if you click that button. You can also click "Unsubscribe" to register your browser at any time.

## Troubleshooting

If you’re interested in sending Web Push notifications, then it will be good to know why they might work.

### Browser support

Most web browsers support Web Push notifications (according to [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/?search=web%20push)), but let’s check:

<%= render partial: "pwa/web_pushes/test" %>

To render the test, this article is running a small snippet of JavaScript similar to this:

```js
if (window.PushManager) {
  // the current browser supports the Push API and Web Push Notifications
} else {
  // fallback for browsers that don’t support this feature
}
```

For some browsers, you may need to add the app to your home screen before Web Push notifications can be enabled. You can try that with the Joy of Rails install button:

<%= render Pwa::InstallButton %>

You can use the install button above to either launch the installation prompt in supporting browsers or, at least, view installation instructions for your browser. When the process completes, Joy of Rails will be available a standalone application on your device.

### Browser notification settings

You may have been able to Subscribe to Web Push but you still didn’t get a notification. If you’re in a supported browser, it’s possible that notifications are disabled in your browser which means when the Web Push event is received the Service Worker won’t be able to trigger a notification. ![Screenshot](articles/web-push-notifications-from-rails/chrome-macos-notifications-permissions.jpg 'Google Chrome Notifications setting from address bar | {"class":"pull-right"}')

Try checking your Notification settings. This setting can be controlled per origin. In Chrome for macOS, for example, you should be able to check your Notification settings for any site from the address bar.

### System settings

You also might need to check you operating System Settings.

In macOS, for example, you may need to go to the System Settings app and the Notifications settings for your browser: ![System Settings Notifications Chrome](articles/web-push-notifications-from-rails/system-settings-notifications.jpg 'macOS System Settings > Notifications > Google Chrome | {"class":"pull-right row-span-2"}')

System Settings on macOS also has a Focus tab with a Do Not Disturb feature. It’s easy to forget about this one—ask me how I found that out while testing this article after hours. ![System Settings Focus Do Not Disturb](articles/web-push-notifications-from-rails/system-settings-focus-do-no-disturb.jpg 'macOS System Settings > Focus > Do Not Disturb | {"class":"pull-right row-span-2"}')

### Expired Subscriptions

Another reason a Web Push notification fails to deliver could be because your browser’s Web Push subscription to this site has gone stale. This may be unlikely if this is the first time visiting the site, but the likelihood increases especially if you’re coming back to the site after some time. So you could try resubscribing using the buttons above.

### Bug 🐞 ???

Finally, it’s possible I’ve introduced a regression since the last time I tested, so you could check your web browser’s dev tools for JavaScript errors. Feel free to [report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/joyofrails/joyofrails.com/issues) with supporting information if you think there’s a bug.

## How does it work?

There are three parties involved in delivering a push message.

- Your Application Server
- Your user
- A Push Server

When your Rails app determines something is worthy of notifying a subscribed user, it makes an HTTP request to a Push Server endpoint with the user’s Web Push subscription and a message payload. It’s this third party Push Server that actually sends the notification to the user. ![Web Push messaging flow](articles/web-push-notifications-from-rails/web-push-flow.svg 'Diagram courtesy of web.dev https://web.dev/articles/push-notifications-web-push-protocol | {"class": "img:bg-joy-color-100"}')

One thing developers miss about this Push Server is a third party, which, in most cases, is managed by the big company behind your browser, namely Google, Apple, Mozilla, or Microsoft.

As the developer implementing Web Push, you’ll need to do the following:

- provide a user experience for a visitor to subscribe to Web Push,
- send the Web Push subscription data to Rails from the frontend,
- make a Web Push request to the third party Push Server (using the `web-push` gem),
- listen for the `'push'` event on the frontend in a [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to display the notification

Here’s how it works at a high level: ![High level view of Web Push](articles/web-push-notifications-from-rails/push-notifications-high-level.png 'Diagram courtesy of the Firefox wiki https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Push_Notifications')

Breaking it down:

1. We’ll use JavaScript on the user’s current page to [register a service
   worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register)
   subscribe to push notifications via the
   [`pushManager`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager/subscribe)
   interface. The browser will make a request to the Web Push server to a
   [`PushSubscription`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription)
   which will contain a unique endpoint to the Web Push server and authorization
   keys required for encrypting the push notification request body.

1. We’ll post the subscription info to our Rails app to allow the notification
   to be sent.

1. To send a push notification, we’ll use the
   [`web-push`](https://github.com/push-pad/web-push) Ruby gem triggered from our
   Rails app. `web-push` is responsible for [encrypting of the message
   payload](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/web-push-encryption?hl=en)
   and sending the request to "push" the notification for the given subscription
   via a third-party Web Push server, i.e., Google, Apple, and Mozilla all host
   their own Push Servers to support the Push API in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox
   respectively.

1. If the request is successful, the Web Push server opens a socket to our
   registered service worker which can listen for `'push'` events to show a
   notification to the user. Since service workers have a lifecycle independent of
   the web page, they can process events even when the user isn’t actively using
   our website.

## Web Push Auth is spelled VAPID

Before we jump into the details of sending a Web Push notification from Rails, a word about security.

When a Web Push notification is triggered by an application, like your Rails app, the application authenticates with the Push Service using the [Voluntary Application server Identification (VAPID)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-vapid-01) protocol. Application servers use VAPID to identify themselves to the push servers so push subscriptions can be properly restricted to their origin app servers. VAPID prevents an attacker from stealing a user’s `PushSubscription` and sending push messages to that recipient from another server.

Luckily, the details of the VAPID spec are abstracted away in the `web-push` Ruby gem. (I should know, I wrote [its initial implementation of the VAPID protocol](https://github.com/zaru/webpush/pull/26) 😅).

You will need to create and securely store a set of VAPID keys. More on that below.

## A Recipe for Web Push

Before a Web Push message can be delivered, a few criteria should be satisfied:

1. [Manifest](#the-manifest): A Progressive Web App `manifest.json` file is linked from our page to identify our app settings.
1. [Service Worker](#register-the-service-worker): In the user’s web browser, a service worker script is installed and activated.
1. [VAPID](#generating-vapid-keys): You have generated a set of VAPID keys that will be used to sign Push API requests. This is a one-time step (at least until we decide to reset the keys).
1. [Permissions](#requesting-notification-permission): The user has enabled permissions to receive notifications from our site.
1. [Subscription](#subscribing-to-push-notifications): The `pushManager` property of the `ServiceWorkerRegistration` is subscribed to push events with our VAPID public key, with creates a `subscription` JSON object on the client side.
1. [Trigger](#triggering-a-web-push-notification): Some trigger results in a Web Push notification. The `subscription` obtained from the client is needed to send the Web Push request from Rails.
1. [Listener](#displaying-the-notification): Your service worker is set up to receive `'push'` events and display a notification.

## The Manifest

Previously, I wrote about the manifest file in [Add your Rails app to the Home Screen - the Ultimate Guide](/articles/add-your-rails-app-to-the-home-screen). I’ve provided a quick recap below.

Since the Rails 7.2, Rails provides defaults for Progressive Web App manifest JSON and serviceworker JavaScript files ([pull request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50528)).

In your Rails 7.2+ `config/routes.rb` file, make sure you have the following routes added:

```rb:{"filename": "config/routes.rb", "highlight_lines": [3, 4]}
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Render dynamic PWA files from app/views/pwa/*
  get "service-worker" => "rails/pwa#service_worker", as: :pwa_service_worker
  get "manifest" => "rails/pwa#manifest", as: :pwa_manifest
end
```

We’ll need to register the manifest with the browser by linking from the HTML document. Your application layout should render a `<link>` tag for the manifest file:

```erb:{"filename": "app/views/layouts/application.html.erb", "highlight_lines": [5]}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- -->
    <%= tag.link rel: "manifest", href: pwa_manifest_path(format: :json) %>
  </head>
  <!-- -->
```

You should also have corresponding files in `app/views/pwa`:

<%= image_tag "articles/web-push-notifications-from-rails/app-views-pwa.jpg", alt: "Rails app file directory displaying app/views/pwa" %>

- `manifest.json.erb`
- `serviceworker.js.erb`

_What if my app isn’t on Rails 7.2?_ That’s ok! If you can’t upgrade now, you can still set up your Rails app similarly. Simply copy the files and routes changes as described here.

For a newly generated Rails 7.2 application, this is what you’ll see in `manifest.json.erb`:

```json:{"filename": "app/views/pwa/manifest.json.erb"}
{
  "name": "YourNewApp",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icon.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "512x512"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icon.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "purpose": "maskable"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "scope": "/",
  "description": "YourNewApp.",
  "theme_color": "red",
  "background_color": "red"
}
```

The default manifest may be enough for [minimal manifest criteria](#your-app) to allow your app be installable, but (as of this writing) browsers may require an icon with dimensions 192x192 (more on icons below).

If you’re not on Rails 7.2 yet, you may also need to add a controller like the one provided by default in Rails 7.2+:

```rb:{"filename": "app/controllers/rails/pwa_controller.rb"}
# frozen_string_literal: true

class Rails::PwaController < Rails::ApplicationController
  skip_forgery_protection

  def service_worker
    render template: "pwa/service-worker", layout: false
  end

  def manifest
    render template: "pwa/manifest", layout: false
  end
end
```

## Register the service worker

Next, we need to tell the browser where to find our Service Worker file.

In our application javascript we’ll use this following snippet to request registration of a service worker script.

```javascript
const registerServiceWorker = async () => {
  if (navigator.serviceWorker) {
    try {
      await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/serviceworker.js');
      console.log('Service worker registered!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error registering service worker: ', error);
    }
  }
};

registerServiceWorker();
```

The key bit is `navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')`. It returns a
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
that, if successful, resolves to an instance of [`ServiceWorkerRegistration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration).

We should be able to see the message `'Service worker registered!'` in our browser’s dev tools console when the promise resolves.

## Generating VAPID keys

To take advantage of the VAPID protocol, we would generate a public/private VAPID key pair to store on our server to be used for all user subscriptions.

In Ruby, we can use the `web-push` gem to generate a VAPID key that has both a `public_key` and `private_key` attribute to be saved on the server side.

```ruby:{"filename": "Gemfile"}
gem 'web-push'
```

We can generate the VAPID public and private keys on the Rails console:

```ruby:{"filename": "bin/rails console"}
vapid_key = WebPush.generate_key

# Save these in our application server settings
vapid_key.public_key.delete("=")
# => "BC1mp...HQ"

vapid_key.private_key
# => "XhGUr...Kec"
```

The keys returned will both be Base64-encoded byte strings. Only the public key
will be shared, both with the user’s browser and the push server as we’ll see
later.

## Requesting Notification permission

Before the notifications can be displayed, the user must grant permission for [notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification) in a browser prompt, using something like the example below.

```javascript
export const checkPermission = async () => {
  switch (Notification.permission) {
    case 'granted':
      console.log('Permission to receive notifications has been granted');
      break;
    case 'denied':
      console.log('Permission to receive notifications has been denied');
      break;
    default:
      const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();
      console.log(`Permission to receive notifications has been ${permission}`);
      break;
  }
};
```

You should be able to adapt this logic to fit your own user experience, such as to message the user that Web Push will be disabled as long as their browser’s notification permission is denied.

## Subscribing to push notifications

The VAPID public key we generated earlier is made available to the client from Ruby.

```erb:{"filename": "app/views/layouts/application.html.erb", "highlight_lines": [5]}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- -->
    <%= tag.meta name: "vapid-public-key", content: Rails.configuration.x.vapid.public_key %>
  </head>
  <!-- -->
```

Your application javascript would then use the `pushManager` property to subscribe to push notifications, passing the VAPID public key to the subscription settings.

```javascript
const vapidPublicKey = document.querySelector(
  'meta[name="vapid-public-key"]',
).content;

export const subscribe = async () => {
  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;

  let subscription = await registration.pushManager.getSubscription();

  if (!subscription) {
    subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({
      userVisibleOnly: true,
      applicationServerKey: vapidPublicKey,
    });

    if (!subscription) {
      console.error('Web push subscription failed');
    }
  }

  return subscription;
};
```

The call to `pushManager.subscribe()` returns a Promise that provides the `PushSubscription` instance with all the information the push service needs to send a push message to this user’s browser. This includes an `endpoint`, the URL on the push server where we’ll send the push request, and a pair of `keys` labelled as `p256dh` and `auth` required to encrypt the push message payload.

```javascript
// subscription.toJSON();
{
  endpoint: "https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send/a-subscription-id",
  keys: {
    auth: 'AEl35...7fG',
    p256dh: 'Fg5t8...2rC'
  }
}
```

If you are interested to learn more about how this encryption works, check out this detailed summary on [Web Push payload encryption](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/web-push-encryption).

In the example below, we send the subscription object to our backend. It could be stored in a session or database record.

```javascript
import { post } from '@rails/request.js';

const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;
const subscription = registration.pushManager.getSubscription();

const {
  endpoint,
  keys: { p256dh, auth },
} = subscription.toJSON();

const body = JSON.stringify({
  push_subscription: { endpoint, p256dh_key: p256dh, auth_key: auth },
});

post('/push_subscriptions', { body });
```

Note that, once subscribed, `pushManager.getSubscription()` returns a Promise that provides the `PushSubscription` instance with all the information the push service needs to send a push message to this user’s browser.

A database record to store a subscription would store the `endpoint`, `auth` key, and `p256dh` and is tied to an account record, like a `User`. Storing the `user_agent` is an optional convenience.

```ruby
create_table :push_subscriptions, force: :cascade do |t|
  t.references :user, null: false, index: true
  t.string :endpoint
  t.string :p256dh_key
  t.string :auth_key
  t.timestamps

  t.string :user_agent
end
```

```ruby:{"filename":"app/controllers/push_subscriptions_controller.rb"}
class Users::PushSubscriptionsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    if subscription = @push_subscriptions.find_by(push_subscription_params)
      subscription.touch
    else
      @push_subscriptions.create! push_subscription_params.merge(user_agent: request.user_agent)
    end

    head :ok
  end

  private

  def push_subscription_params
    params.require(:push_subscription).permit(:endpoint, :p256dh_key, :auth_key)
  end
end
```

## Triggering a Web Push notification

Imagine a use case for your Rails app to trigger a Web Push notification. Perhaps you published a new article and want to inform your readers.

Now it’s time to trigger the request to the Push Server with the `web-push` gem. Here’s what it could look like as implemented in an ActiveJob:

```ruby:{"filename":"app/jobs/web_push_job.rb"}
class WebPushJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(title:, message:, endpoint:, p256dh_key:, auth_key:)
    message_json = {
      title: title,
      body: message,
      icon: ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_url("app-icons/icon-192.png")
    }.to_json

    response = WebPush.payload_send(
      message: message_json,
      endpoint: endpoint,
      p256dh: p256dh_key,
      auth: auth_key,
      vapid: {
        subject: "mailto:hello@joyofrails.com",
        public_key: Rails.configuration.x.vapid.public_key,
        private_key: Rails.configuration.x.vapid.private_key
      }
    )
  end
end
```

The `WebPush.payload_send` method requires you to provide the user’s subscription attributes, VAPID public and private keys, and a message payload serialized as JSON.

For the message payload, I am setting the `title`, `body`, and `icon` properties. The [MDN Notification docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification) and this [web.dev Notification article](https://web.dev/articles/push-notifications-display-a-notification) are good resources to learn more about the options you have available.

```ruby
subscription = user.push_subscriptions.last

WebPushJob.perform_later(
  title: "Hello from Joy of Rails 🌈",
  message: "You can subscribe to my newsletter below! ",
  endpoint: subscription.endpoint,
  p256dh_key: subscription.p256dh_key,
  auth_key: subscription.auth_key
)
```

To trigger the job, we just need to deserialize the user’s subscription and to send them a worthwhile message 😉.

## Displaying the notification

Because the service worker runs in the background, this is where we need to listen for Web Push notifications delivered from the Push Server.

In `app/views/pwa/serviceworker.js.erb`, we can use the service worker API to show notifications when the `'push'` event is received:

```javascript:{"filename":"app/views/pwa/serviceworker.js.erb"}
const onPush = (event) => {
  console.log('[Serviceworker]', 'Push event!', event.data.json());
  const { title, ...options } = event.data.json();

  const showNotification = self.registration.showNotification(title, {
    icon,
    ...options,
  });

  event.waitUntil(showNotification);
};

self.addEventListener('push', onPush);
```

The MDN docs are a good resource for more on [service worker `self`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope) and [the service worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API).

After all that setup, we should see a browser notification triggered via the Push API.

## Wrap up

Overall, the Web Push API is an interesting step for the web in terms of feature parity with mobile.

As you can see, Web Push takes quite a bit of setup. Things may get easier once Action Notifier is released. Even when it is released, I think this article will still be relevant to help you understand the key ingredients of what’s required to wire up native push notifications with web technology.

I’d be interested to hear how things are working out for folks integrating Web Push into their web apps.

What do you think?

One more thing—a great resource to learn more about Web Push is the [Pushpad blog](https://pushpad.xyz/blog) from the maintainer of the `web-push` gem!
